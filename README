Welcome!

This project sprung out of my desire to read KeePass databases on Qt-less
platforms (I had a Nokia N770 at the time).  Well, I no longer use it, but I
kept working at libkpass and decided to make this client to show the library
actually works.  It may sound petty, but I also much prefer the way GTK
searches through entries when typing within a list.  I'm also in a position of
having two databases, one for work and one for home.  This is the only client
that I know of that lets the user open multiple at one time.  Hopefully it will
even allow seamless movement of passwords between databases, but I shouldn't
get ahead of myself.

Enjoy!
